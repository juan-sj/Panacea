A virtual app for medical prescriptions to be used by doctors and patients 

This paper clarifies a methodology wherein you can plan and endorse the medication in a digitized position. It incorporates a web application and two android applications. A web-based interface for recommending drugs by the specialist, an android application for viewing the prescription for the patient and in this manner producing a QR code which can later be scanned by the drug specialist application for creating the remedy at the store. In this way it takes care of the issue of taking the prescription to the pharmacy. The application additionally sets remainders, updates and notices dependent on the information given by the doctor.
